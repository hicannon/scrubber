\begin{abstract}

In this paper we decided to investigate the application of robotics to the domestic chore of using a sponge to wipe down a table after a meal. We divided the problem into two main components; stain identification and cleaning kinematics. For the stain identification sub-problem we mainly focused on developing algorithms that would enable a robot to correctly identify stains. We first developed and experimented with a series of methods to extract features from stains in images. To increase accuracy we then use machine learning techniques to classify stained sections on images. Resulting tests of the machine learning classification of stains suggests that the utilizes thing but stuff still occurs.

\section{Motivation}

While domestic applications of robots have been highlighted in popular culture practically applying robotics to accurately perform household tasks remains an open and interesting problem. In this paper we investigate the application of robots to a particular household task, specifically the task of using a sponge to wipe down a table after a meal.

Our initial approach towards stain detection used the Watershed image segmentation algorithm. Specifically, watershed by flooding~\cite{watershed} was utilized. The segmentation process initially erodes the image to obtain seed points, which are defined as pixels whose values are close to their neighbors. The watershed algorithm is then run on the seed points to obtain a segmentation. The watershed algorithm was initially chosen because of its speed and ability to clearly segment trivial test cases. However, several disadvantages were
